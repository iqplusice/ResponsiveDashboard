This is a walkthrough of the site by AsmrProg found at https://github.com/AsmrProg-YT/ site.

It demonstrates the use of pure HTML, JavaScript and CSS to build a responsive dashboard with light and darkmode UI.

I have replicated it here to see how it can be done and I must say it was an exciting experience.
